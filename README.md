# Bindings

## Javascript libraries/frameworks

- Standard library
	Binding to the javascript standard library
	* [ocaml-js-stdlib](https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-js-stdlib) with
	  gen_js_api.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
	Jquery provides some objects and methods to improve the DOM manipulation and
	event handling.
	* Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-jquery](https://github.com/kitec/ocaml-jquery) (more
	  up to date, forked from https://github.com/gabriel-cardoso/ocaml-jquery)
	* Binding with gen_js_api in [ocaml-js-stdlib](https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-js-stdlib).

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
	Instead of using javascript only in a web browser, Nodejs allows you to use
	javascript on your system by providing a javascript interpreter running on
	top of [Google V8 javascript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/)
	Nodejs has lots of module which give you the possibility to run, for
	example, an http server.
	* Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-nodejs](https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-nodejs)

- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
	D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3
	helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web
	standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying
	yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization
	components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
	* Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-d3](https://github.com/seliopou/ocaml-d3) (can be
	  installed with opam install d3)

- [extjs](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/#overview)
	* Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-extjs](https://github.com/astrada/ocaml-extjs)

- [reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
	* Binding in js_of_ocaml: [reactjs_of_ocaml](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/reactjs_of_ocaml)

- [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)
	* Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-electron](https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-electron)

## Mobile development

- [Cordova plugins](https://cordova.apache.org/)
	Cordova allows you to develop hybrid mobile applications using web technologies. Through plugins, you can access to devices features.
	* [Bindings to cordova plugins](https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-list) with js_of_ocaml and gen_js_api.

# *Pure* OCaml web frameworks/libraries

* [ocsigen](https://ocsigen.org): The ocsigen project is aimed at proposing clean and safe tools for developing and running client/server web 2.0 applications.

# Tools to create bindings

OCaml to javascript compilers:
* [js_of_ocaml](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml)
* [Bucklescript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript)

Tools to simplify bindings:
* [gen_js_api](https://github.com/lexifi/gen_js_api)

# To-do

## Typescript/Javascript

* [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) aims to develop a typed javascript. [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) contains a lot of bindings to popular javascript libraries. It would be useful to have a compiler ocaml to typescript and use this repository as reference.

## HTML/CSS

* Think about typed CSS with OCaml.

* Create typed bindings to CSS frameworks such as [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/).

* Functions to create style HTML elements such as buttons, containers, rows, etc using popular CSS libraries --> Simplify HTML5 pages builds.

## Hybrid mobile programming

* [Ionic](https://ionic.io/) allows to develop hybrid mobile applications with a native apparence using web technologies. There are [ionic plugins](https://market.ionic.io/plugins) written in Javascript.

## Tools

* Integration with popular text editors/IDE.

* A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
