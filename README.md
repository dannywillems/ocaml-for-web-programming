# Bindings

## Javascript libraries/frameworks

* Standard library
  Binding to the javascript standard library
  - [ocaml-js-stdlib](https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-js-stdlib) with
    gen_js_api.

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  Jquery provides some objects and methods to improve the DOM manipulation and
  event handling.
  - Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-jquery](https://github.com/kitec/ocaml-jquery) (more
    up to date, forked from https://github.com/gabriel-cardoso/ocaml-jquery)
  - Binding with gen_js_api in [ocaml-js-stdlib](https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-js-stdlib).

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
  Instead of using javascript only in a web browser, Nodejs allows you to use
  javascript on your system by providing a javascript interpreter running on
  top of [Google V8 javascript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/)
  Nodejs has lots of module which give you the possibility to run, for
  example, an http server.
  - Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-nodejs](https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-nodejs)

* [D3](https://d3js.org/)
  D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3
  helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web
  standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying
  yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization
  components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
  - Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-d3](https://github.com/seliopou/ocaml-d3) (can be
    installed with opam install d3)

* [extjs](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/#overview)
  - Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-extjs](https://github.com/astrada/ocaml-extjs)

* [reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
  - Binding in js_of_ocaml: [reactjs_of_ocaml](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/reactjs_of_ocaml)

* [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)
  - Binding in js_of_ocaml: [ocaml-electron](https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-electron)

## Mobile development

* [Cordova plugins](https://cordova.apache.org/)
  Cordova allows you to develop hybrid mobile applications using web technologies. Through plugins, you can access to devices components.
  - [Bindings to cordova plugins](https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-list) with js_of_ocaml and gen_js_api.

# Running OCaml program in browsers

OCaml to javascript compilers:
* [Ocsigen js_of_ocaml](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml)
* [Bloomberg Bucklescript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript)

Tools to simplify bindings:
* [gen_js_api](https://github.com/lexifi/gen_js_api)

# *Pure* OCaml web frameworks/libraries

## Typed HTML/CSS

* [Ocsigen Tyxml](http://ocsigen.org/tyxml/): Library to build statically correct Html and Svg

## Server and client side

* [Ocsigen Eliom](http://ocsigen.org/eliom/):
  - Server side page generation (and continuation based Web programming)
  - Language extension for client-server Web application in OCaml
  - Session manipulation
  - Reactive Web pages
  - Mobile applications in OCaml with Apache Cordova

* [Ocsigen Toolkit](http://ocsigen.org/ocsigen-widgets/): Native OCaml widgets for client or client-server Web applications

## Web servers

* [Ocsigen Server](http://ocsigen.org/ocsigenserver/): Modular Web server (using cohttp or its own http library) with https, access control, authentication, user configuration files, reverse proxy, CGI scripts, etc.

## Client side

## Mobile development

* [Ocsigen Eliom](http://ocsigen.org/eliom/):
  - Server side page generation (and continuation based Web programming)
  - Language extension for client-server Web application in OCaml
  - Session manipulation
  - Reactive Web pages
  - Mobile applications in OCaml with Apache Cordova

* [Ocsigen Eliom base app](http://ocsigen.org/eliom-base-app/): High level library and application template with user management, notifications, mobile app (work in progress)

# To-do

## Typescript/Javascript

* [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) aims to develop a typed javascript. [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) contains a lot of bindings to popular javascript libraries. It would be useful to have a compiler ocaml to typescript and use this repository as reference.

* Bindings to popular javascript frameworks
  - Angularjs
  - Backbone.js
  - Ember.js
  - JQueryUI
  - Babylon
  - Karma
  - Phantom JS

## HTML/CSS

* Think about typed CSS with OCaml.

* Create typed bindings to CSS frameworks such as [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/).

* Functions to create style HTML elements such as buttons, containers, rows, etc using popular CSS libraries --> Simplify HTML5 pages builds. We can imagine to have a module for each popular CSS libraries. For example, we can have with bootstrap
```OCaml
module B = Bootstrap_css
B.create_container (B.create_row (B.create_col 4 ~lg:3 ~md:6 ~xs:12))
```
giving as output
```HTML
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-xs-12"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-xs-12"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-xs-12"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-xs-12"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
Use Tyxml ?

## Hybrid mobile programming

* [Ionic](https://ionic.io/) allows to develop hybrid mobile applications with a native apparence using web technologies. There are [ionic plugins](https://market.ionic.io/plugins) written in Javascript (different than cordova plugins).

## Tools

* Integration with popular text editors/IDE.

* A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

* Task runners such as Gulp/Grunt
